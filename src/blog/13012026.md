I have basically finished all of my mandatory courses in my home university and I decided to dig in to new subject at my studies in Mataró. Although I'm focusing on software developing I thought it would be nice to laern about business related topics so for my first term I chose Financial Management for one of my courses. In the unit one we went through what's the financial role of the company and related topics like financial market, assets, spending units and so on.

So, the financial market can be described as a place or mechanism where **financial assets** are bought or sold and where their prices are determined. Financial assets are non-physical assets whose value comes from contractual claim rather than physical worth like gold or land does. Examples of those financial assets are:

- Stocks (equity): ownership share in company
- Bonds (dept): loan to a company or government
- Bank deposits: cash deposit against a bank
- Derivates: value derived from an underlying asset (futures, options)

There's basically two factors which determines the value/return of financial asset. First one is supply and demand. In simple example lower supply but higher demand means higher value for asset. Higher supply but low demand means lower value. Second factor is risk. Higher risk means greater probability of higher return. Therefore lower risk means greater probability of lower return.

Financial market contacts two kind of economic agents which are **Surplus spending unit** which earns more than spends and **deficit spending units** which has spent more than earned in period of time. To raise funds to finance their deficit they may sell dept or equity. So, the surplus units are buyers and deficit units are sellers.

Overall the spending units would be public sector, companies, families or other countries and organizations. The example of financial market and the units could be following. New company has financial assets and demand for funding. Investor has funds and obtain a future return. These two units meet and create financial market. If these two units do the transfer directly from each to other, it's called direct transaction. Other way is indirect transaction which means that there's for example a bank between the buyer and seller. In that case the funds goes to the bank from the buyer and goes to the seller as a loan for example. The seller gives assets to the bank and the buyer gets interest from the bank.

**Main functions of financial markets are:**

- connect the economic units that supply and demand funds
- assign prices to financial products
- facilitate the liquidity of assets and economy in general
- reduce the terms and intermediate costs

In overall we can talk about **financial system** which is the set of institutions, markets and intruments that facilitate the flow of funds from savers to borrowers. Its main goal is to efficiently allocate financial resources and risks in the economy. Three main components of financial system are **financial assets**, **financial institutions** and **financial markets**.

Financial markets can be classified in several ways. Here's a list with simple examples.

**Asset transformation**

- Bank transfers a person's bank deposit to a loan for someone else

**Market structure (how sellers and buyers meet)**

- Direct search: trying to find each other directly (inefficient and slow)
- Broker market: pay an agent to find match (e.g. eToro, Nordnet. Middleman, like a real estate agent, doesn't own the assets)
- Dealer market: sell directly to market maker without searching a buyer (e.g. NASDAQ, JPMorgan, owns the assets, takes a risk)
- Auction market: all orders are centralized at one point and matched automatically (e.g. NYSE)

**Degree of formalisation**

- Organized (e.g. NYSE) - Over-the-counter (OTC)

**Term of the assets**

- Spot contract (immediate delivery and payment, spot price is current price of the asset)
- Forward / futures contract (contract to sell or buy asset on specified price on a future date)

**Phase of negotiation**

- Primary market (e.g. company itself issues shares to investors, for example when listing to stock market)
- Secondary market (e.g. investors buy and sell stocks, company gets 0€)

**Asset type**

- Money market (short term debpt, <1 year)
- Capital market (stock marker, bond market)
- Foreign exchange market (e.g. Forex, currencies)
- Commodities market (raw materials)
- Cryptocurrency market (digital assets)
- Derivatives market (futures and options)
